# ps149
This is a Github repository for UCLA PS149.

Here are instructions for setting up R, Rstudio, and the tidyverse on your machine. These are mostly lifted and shifted from the email I sent out in the beginning of class.

Greetings!

I'm your TA for PS149, Igor. 

Unlike past courses where you might have worked in a sandbox environment online (e.g., Jupyter notebooks/CourseKata), you will be running R 'locally' on your 'machine'. This means that you will have access to a whole bunch more of the things that R allows you to do (yay!) but it does mean you have to install a few things.

***If you can do the following before class please do--it'll give us more time to talk about cool and interesting things.***

1. Download the appropriate version of R (i.e. Mac, Windows, etc.) from here: https://cran.r-project.org/
2. Download RStudio (a tool that allows us to use R) here: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/. Absolutely download the free version. There is no earthly reason for you to pay for using R for the things we do in this class (one of its perks).
3. Open Rstudio at least one time before class and ideally have it open/running on your laptop when you come to class. You do this in the usual way (double click the shortcut on your Desktop, pull it up in your Start menu / Spotlight search, click on the icon in Dock (Mac), etc.).

If you have any questions about the above just drop me an email / Bruinlearn message. Generally you can think of installing R like installing any other program/software/game, etc.

***Especially if you aren't able to do the above, but in either case, bring your laptop to class if you can.***

If you don't have access to a laptop, we can talk about it. But if you do please bring it charged to class. The best way to learn the code-based stuff we do in class is by doing it alongside me and then doing it again on your own.

***Attached is a little syllabus we can use to guide our meetings in discussion this quarter.***

This isn't as big of a deal as Prof Thompson's syllabus which outlines actual policies/grades, etc., but there are a few things you may want to note. I'll also talk a bit about this in class.

That pretty much covers it. (This is also the longest email I will send you all quarter.) Looking forward to meeting you and seeing you in discussion on Friday.

Igor
